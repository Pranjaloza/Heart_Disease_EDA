# 🫀Heart_Disease_EDA
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook that performsExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the UCI Heart Disease dataset.
# 🔍What I Did
-Loaded and cleaned the dataset
-Explored feature distributions using:
   1)Histograms & Boxplots
   2)Violin plots (age vs heart disease)
   3)Count and bar plots (sex, chest pain, etc.)
   4)Pairplots and correlation heatmap
   5)Interactive Plotly scatter plot (age vs cholesterol)
-Identified:
   Trends and patterns related to heart disease
   Outliers using z-scores
   Feature-level inferences from visualizations
